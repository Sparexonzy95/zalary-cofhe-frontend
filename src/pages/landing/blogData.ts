        title: "Payroll needs more than payment rails",
        body: "Salary operations include approval, funding, employee identity, execution timing, and claim status. When these pieces are handled in public or fragmented systems, teams inherit unnecessary exposure. Private salary infrastructure treats payroll as an end-to-end workflow, not a single transfer event.",

        title: "Privacy and verification should work together",
        body: "Companies need confidence that a run was funded and executed, while employees need a simple path to claim. The goal is not to hide operational truth. The goal is to reveal only what each participant needs to act.",

        title: "Exposure often comes from workflow shape",
        body: "Payroll systems can leak context even when no single screen looks dangerous. Repeated amounts, timing patterns, approval trails, and wallet relationships can tell a story. A privacy-first workflow reduces those signals at the structure level.",

      {
        title: "Reduce what every participant can infer",
